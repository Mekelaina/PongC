# PONG! But in C
This is a simple implementation of PONG written in C using Raylib.
<br><br>
It was done as an exercise to see if i could make Pong in one sitting, as well as to get a bit more comfortable with raylib before tackling larger game projects.
<br>
I could've finished it in one sitting but it got really late and i needed sleep :/
<br>
Next time I try a "one sitting" challenge, I will do it eariler in the day.
<hr>
I will update this when the project is finsihed with all the docs and stuff.
